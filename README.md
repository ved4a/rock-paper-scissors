This is a 5-round game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

The "backstory" is that Humanity is attempting to regain control of the Earth from technology. Perhaps a tad bit complex for the functionality of the game.

I initially created this to be played in the console, but now it is entirely functional to be played using GUI! A fun little addition I made was to make the "Rock" symbol an electric guitar. Whoever happens to come across this repo, enjoy!
